### Hi there I'm Kevin LE VAN PHUNG ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on OpenClassrooms projects in order to become a Junior Web developper worthy of your time 

### My history

I discovered code in ingeneering school where I mostly did C and Java. Unfortunately other than the code I didn't quite like the other things I learnt there.
I later went to the 42 School in Paris but thought it was lacking concrete projects for me to work on.

I then decide to learn code through the OpenClassrooms formation and I hope it will fulfill all my desires and ambitions regarding the Web Development !
